# Application Enhancement Project

This project is set up to work with an existing web application that will be imported from GitHub.

## Current Status
- Awaiting codebase import from GitHub
- Environment configured with database secrets
- Ready for enhancement and modification work

## Available Environment Variables
- DATABASE_URL
- PostgreSQL connection details (PGDATABASE, PGHOST, PGPASSWORD, PGPORT, PGUSER)
- TORN_API_KEY

## Tech Stack (Expected)
- Vite build system
- Frontend framework (TBD based on imported code)
- Backend implementation (TBD based on imported code)
- PostgreSQL database
- Existing styling approach

## Next Steps
1. Import existing codebase from GitHub
2. Analyze current application structure
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Implement requested enhancements
5. Test modifications thoroughly

## Development Guidelines
- Preserve existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on incremental improvements
- Use existing tech stack and architecture
- Ensure thorough testing before deployment

## Port Configuration
- Frontend: Port 5000 (if web application)
- Backend: Port 8000 (if separate backend service)
- Host binding: 0.0.0.0 for container compatibility
